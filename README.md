# WikiRunnr

Start at a randomly spawned Wikipedia URL and try reaching the assigned target
in the shortest time. Speedrun and explore Wikipedia. 

## Libraries Used

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
    - [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)
        - [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)

## Future Considerations

- [ ] Basic solo speedrun game
- [ ] Enable PvP multiplayer using web sockets. 
- [ ] Social element (Account creation, etc.)
- [ ] Create difficulty gradients by analyzing "connectedness" of each article"

## Inspiration

- [Tom Scott's newsletter](https://www.tomscott.com/newsletter/) - where I
  first saw the mention of the Wiki Game and the following video.
- [How One Small Change Broke Wikipedia's First Link Rule (by Not
  David)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-llumS2rA8I): Got me interested in
  connected graphs and visualizations of Wikipedia as a whole.
- [The Wiki Game](https://www.thewikigame.com/play/): A similar (almost exact
  at its core) wikipedia game.

## Aside

Seems like I'm not the first person to get this idea üòÅ. People have beaten me
to it. But, development in this project shall continue until I can fully
realize the game I planned.
